## Description
A simple physics engine with tweakable parameters. Use the bottom sliders to control:

Ball Radius (in pixels)

Gravity (in pixels/timestep^2)

Air resistance (velocity scaling applied at each time step)

Collision Dampening: Directional velocity scaling applied when a wall is hit

Mouse Pull Factor: A constand acceleration in the direction of the mouse when mouse is pressed.
